<p>As a shocking natives enthusiast I was planning to learn Italian for my upcoming trip, but I keep seeing videos of people breaking spaghetti or putting ketchup on pasta and getting really strong reactions from Italians around them. And these videos get millions of views. On the other hand, I never see Italians being impressed by anyone speaking their language. So why do people even learn it when it's enough to just play around with food?
